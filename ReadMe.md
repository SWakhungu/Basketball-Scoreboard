# Basketball Scoreboard Project
As part of the Scrimba JavaScript learning module- link here https://scrimba.com/learn/learnjavascript/solo-project-basketball-scoreboard-cz9adVfP - this project involves testing of various concepts from basic (variables) to intermediate (functions) to a little bit advanced (DOM methods such as document.getElementById). The idea is to have a scoreboard that adds points scored and eventually resets the score back to zero. The design has largely been followed in terms of execution but there is room for improvement nonetheless.
## Technologies used
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. JavaScript

## Installation process
Clone the project to your local using the git clone command `git clone <repository-url>`.
Navigate to the appropriate directory on your local repository using the `cd` command in the interface and use `code .` command to open the VS Code editor (my preferred editor; one can use whichever editor suits their need/preference), from where you will work on the files. There will be three files for the project in the 'repository-url' thus copied that will need to be created - html file, style.css file, and a script.js file. There is also a folder with the required fonts for the score display.
Always check the status of the working directory using `git status`, add files using `git add 'file name'`, and practice good version control by commiting frequently with `git commit -m "Message"`.

## Support
I feel this could be better considering the stretch goals suggested even though I applied one, adding a new game button. Do you have suggestions on how to improve the project or information about it? You can reach me on my personal email: stwakhungu@gmail.com.
